# Introduction to Agent Swarm Protocol

## What is Agent Swarm Protocol?

Agent Swarm Protocol (ASP) is an open-source framework designed for orchestrating multiple AI agents to work together as a cohesive system. It provides a standardized way for agents to communicate, collaborate, and coordinate their activities, enabling the creation of complex, multi-agent systems that can tackle sophisticated tasks.

## Key Features

### ðŸ”„ Dynamic Communication
Agents can communicate directly with each other or through an orchestrator, allowing for flexible interaction patterns that adapt to the needs of your application.

### ðŸ§  Specialized Agents
Build purpose-specific agents that excel at particular tasks, from research and content generation to conversation and problem-solving.

### ðŸ“ˆ Scalable Architecture
The protocol is designed to scale from simple two-agent systems to complex networks with dozens of specialized agents working in concert.

### ðŸ”Œ Flexible Integration
Integrate with any LLM provider or AI service through a simple, standardized interface. ASP works with OpenAI, Anthropic, local models, and more.

## Core Concepts

### Agents
An agent is a software entity that can perform tasks, make decisions, and communicate with other agents. In ASP, agents are typically powered by large language models (LLMs) but can incorporate other AI capabilities as needed.

### Tasks
Tasks represent units of work that agents can perform. Each task has a type, input data, and expected output. Agents register to handle specific task types based on their capabilities.

### Orchestrator
The orchestrator manages the lifecycle of tasks, routing them to appropriate agents and handling the communication between agents. It acts as the central coordination point for the entire system.

### Communication
Agents communicate through structured messages, either directly or via the orchestrator. ASP defines standard message formats for requesting information, sending responses, and coordinating activities.

## Getting Started

To start building with Agent Swarm Protocol, check out:

- [Quick Start Guide](/docs/getting-started) - Set up your first agent system
- [Agent Communication](/docs/agent-communication) - Learn how agents interact
- [SDK Documentation](/docs/sdk) - Explore the client library

## Use Cases

Agent Swarm Protocol can be used for a wide range of applications:

- **Research assistants** that can search, analyze, and synthesize information
- **Content creation systems** with specialized agents for ideation, writing, editing, and fact-checking
- **Customer service solutions** where multiple agents handle different aspects of customer inquiries
- **Problem-solving frameworks** where agents break down complex problems into manageable sub-tasks
- **Educational tools** with personalized tutoring from multiple specialized agents
