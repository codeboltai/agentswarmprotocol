# Agent Selection Feature

This feature allows users to select which agent they want to talk to using a dropdown menu in the UI client. 

## Implementation Details

The agent selection feature consists of the following components:

1. **AgentSelector Component** - A new UI component that displays a dropdown menu of available agents with a refresh button to fetch the latest agent list.

2. **BrowserClientSDK Enhancement** - Added a `getAgents()` method to fetch the list of available agents from the orchestrator.

3. **UI Updates** - The chat interface now displays which agent messages are from and allows users to select a specific agent to message.

## How It Works

1. When the UI client connects to the orchestrator, it automatically fetches the list of available agents.
2. The agent selector dropdown shows all online agents with "chat" capability.
3. Users can select an agent from the dropdown to direct their messages to that specific agent.
4. Agent messages are labeled with the agent's name in the chat interface.
5. Users can refresh the agent list manually using the refresh button.

## Benefits

- **Better Multi-Agent Experience**: Users can now choose which agent to interact with instead of broadcasting to all agents.
- **Clearer Conversations**: Each message clearly shows which agent it came from.
- **Improved User Experience**: The UI provides feedback about agent availability and selection.

## Future Improvements

- Agent capability visualization
- Agent status indicators
- Option to broadcast messages to all agents
- Filter agents by capability or status
- Save preferred agent in local storage

## Usage

1. Launch the orchestrator and at least one agent
2. Start the UI client
3. Select an agent from the dropdown at the top of the chat interface
4. Start chatting with your selected agent!
